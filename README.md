# Hi, I'm Siddhi Patel 👋

I'm a first-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.  

I like building interactive projects that combine logic, visuals, and user experience, especially games and tools that feel satisfying to use.

I'm actively interested in:
- Software development
- User-facing applications (desktop / UI)
- Problem solving with code
