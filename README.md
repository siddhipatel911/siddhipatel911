# Hi, I'm Siddhi Patel 👋

I'm a first-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.  

I like building interactive projects that combine logic, visuals, and user experience, especially games and tools that feel satisfying to use.

I'm actively interested in:
- Software development
- User-facing applications (desktop / UI)
- Problem solving with code

## 🚀 Projects

### [Soccer Penalties Game](https://github.com/siddhipatel911/SoccerPenaltiesGame) ⚽️
- A Java Swing penalty shootout game where the player takes 5 shots against an animated goalie.  
- Includes movement animation using `Timer`, score tracking, and a high score system saved to file.

### [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://github.com/siddhipatel911/TicTacToe-5x5) ❌⭕
- Two-player 5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe game with a GUI built in Java Swing.  
- Detects 4-in-a-row in all directions, highlights the winning line in gold, locks the board, and tracks wins/ties across multiple rounds without restarting the program.

### [Memory Card Matching Game](https://github.com/siddhipatel911/MemoryCardMatchingGame) 🧠🎴
- Java Swing memory card matching game with randomized layout, timer, and flip animations.  
- Demonstrates event-driven logic, randomization, and GUI design skills.

### [Student Grades](https://github.com/siddhipatel911/StudentGrades) 🧮📊
- Java Swing application that calculates and displays student and course averages using a resizable 2D array.  
- Demonstrates add/list options, validation, and GUI event handling.

### [Team Division Placement](https://github.com/siddhipatel911/Team-Division-Placement) 🏅
- Python console program that calculates new team divisions based on wins, losses, and ties.

### [Cognitive Delirium Memory Game (Arduino)](https://github.com/siddhipatel911/Delirium Memory Game) 🧠
- A cognitive-assessment memory game designed to help screen for delirium symptoms using an embedded system.
- Built using the Arduino Uno R4, the game generates randomized RGB LED patterns that players must repeat using three input buttons.
- Includes difficulty levels, non-blocking timing logic, round tracking, and a motor-based reward system for correct sequences.
- Demonstrates skills in embedded C++, hardware design, user interaction loops, and real-time logic.

_(More projects coming soon)_  
I’ll keep adding course projects and personal builds here as I go.
